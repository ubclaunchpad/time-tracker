# :alarm_clock: Time Tracker

Time Tracker is an application that lets you track and visualize how you spend your time.

## :heavy_check_mark: Build Status

We use GitHub actions to build the app and run unit and integration tests on all pull requests and commits to the master branch.

[![Build and Tests](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/time-tracker/workflows/Dart%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/time-tracker/actions)

## :computer: Installation

1. The Time Tracker app is built using Flutter. Please follow [this tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up your development environment. We recommend using Android Studio because it allows you to easily test your app on an emulator. 
2. Once you have your development environment set up, either use your IDE's git GUI or the `git clone` command to clone `https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/time-tracker.git`. 
3. If you are using Android Studio, you can then [create a new virtual device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) and [run the app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive?tab=androidstudio#run-the-app).

## :raising_hand: Contributing

The Time Tracker app is still in progress and it is actively being built by UBC Launch Pad members. We welcome any kind of contributions including issues, pull requests, and general feedback. Please see the [UBC Launch Pad Handbook](https://docs.ubclaunchpad.com/resources/git-workflow) for a guide to contributing to UBC Launch Pad projects on GitHub. When you start working on an issue, create a new branch named `[issue number]-[short description]` (eg. `1-input-task`). When you create a pull request, be sure to link it to the issue that the pull request resolves ([see how](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)).
